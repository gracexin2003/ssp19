Special instructions:
None. Just run the code :)

My orbital elements have a pretty low error (for the most part).
I attempted to calculate my ephemeris in the OD, but it didn't work.
My Newton Raphson code also did not work, so I didn't include it in this version of the code either.
The code runs strictly on a set of 4 inputs, because I hard coded the input-taking :(
